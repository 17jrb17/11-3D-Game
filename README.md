# 11-3D-Game
I used a lot of kenney assets to make a decent sized jungle area. I apologize ahead of time for the hundreds of plant objects in there I basically did this in the least organized and non-easy way but it's too late now. I also added particle effects for both fire w/ smoke and rain w/ looping rain and thunder sounds. I also made it dusk/night and added some field of view fog to make visibility a bit lower. The object is to make it to the crashed helicopter (which I made out of random meshes cuz I didn't wanna risk a virus downloading a helicopter mesh from some shady website made in a former soviet satelite state) while avoiding pits/traps. I would've looped fortunate son or paint it black but ya know...copyright stops me from having fun. Enjoy!
